Codes to run simulation for the two-step method, simulation and application

Running the two-step method for analysis when there are misclassification bias and selection bias in two different datasets. 
Method has been shown to work under a simulation study. 
These codes are associated with the publication at the American Journal of Epidemiology: 

A two-step approach to simultaneously correct for selection and misclassification bias in nonprobability samples from hard-to-reach populations
